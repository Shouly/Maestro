# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

Maestro is a cross-platform AI chat application built with Tauri 2.0 that aims to provide AI enthusiasts, developers, creators, and professional researchers a unified, powerful, and scalable interaction experience. By integrating multiple models such as OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude 3 series), Deepseek for programming assistance, and local options like Ollama, Maestro tackles the challenges of fragmented AI tools, limited extensibility, privacy concerns, and cumbersome workflows. The app is designed to offer one-stop access to various AI models while ensuring a smooth and modern interface enhanced by a robust MCP server for custom tool integration.

The project is being built to simplify the AI interaction process and streamline workflows for a diverse target audience. Key objectives include offering a consolidated interface for multiple AI model access, ensuring privacy through local deployment, and enhancing productivity with advanced conversation management (including artifacts storage) and MCP server extensibility. Success will be measured by user engagement, ease of use, robust performance across Windows, macOS, and Linux, and the app's ability to seamlessly integrate diverse AI models in a unified chat experience.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Development of a Tauri 2.0-based cross-platform desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   Integration of multiple AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, Ollama, OpenRouter) through a unified interface.
*   MCP server integration for custom tool and functionality enhancements.
*   Local storage of chat histories and settings to ensure data privacy.
*   Core chat functionalities including conversation management, message history, and Claude-like artifacts for storing key dialogue segments.
*   A modern, minimalist design with the prescribed visual guidelines (bright blue theme, three-panel layout, responsive design, light/dark mode).
*   Handling offline mode gracefully with notifications and local history display.
*   Real-time processing with support for streaming conversation responses and code generation with syntax highlighting.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   User authentication or support for multiple user roles (the app is intended for single-user use).
*   Any third-party integrations beyond the provided AI models and MCP server.
*   Online synchronization of chat histories (all data is stored locally).
*   Advanced offline functionalities beyond viewing past stored data; no new conversations can be initiated while offline.
*   Extensive customizations beyond the approved design system (brands, fonts, and color schemes are already defined).

## 3. User Flow

When a user launches Maestro, the application first checks for network connectivity. If the device is offline, the user is greeted with a friendly notification, informing them about limited functionality while still allowing access to locally stored chat histories. Once online, the app transitions smoothly into its main interface. The central screen displays the active chat area where users can type messages, while a left sidebar allows easy access to conversation history and model selection. A right sidebar is reserved for displaying artifacts, such as saved dialogue highlights and important data points.

During an active session, users can initiate new chats or revisit prior conversations through the intuitive interface. As they interact with the app, messages are processed in real-time using integrated AI models, providing quick and accurate responses. For more detailed or creative tasks, users can employ advanced features such as code generation, parameter adjustments, and direct interactions with the MCP server to extend functionalities. When connectivity issues occur during a session, the app automatically switches to an offline mode where the history remains accessible, and new inputs are paused until the connection is restored seamlessly.

    • Network connectivity is assumed for initiating new conversations; offline functionality is limited to viewing saved histories.\
    • The integration of multiple AI models assumes that corresponding APIs and endpoints are stable and available.\
    • The design guidelines (color schemes, fonts, layout) will be strictly followed as provided in the design documentation.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits & Latency:**\
    • There may be limitations on how often AI models can be queried. Monitor API usage to avoid rate-limiting issues. Consider implementing caching where appropriate.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**\
    • Although Tauri is designed for multiple operating systems, differences in OS behaviors or file system handling could introduce minor inconsistencies. Test thoroughly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Offline Mode Transition:**\
    • Handling internet disconnects might introduce lag or require careful state management to ensure a smooth transition. Implement robust state management to handle these transitions without data loss.
*   **Extensibility via MCP Server:**\
    • Integrating third-party tools through the MCP server might result in unexpected interactions. Define clear API contracts and error-handling mechanisms to mitigate integration risks.
*   **Design Consistency:**\
    • Strict adherence to the design guidelines (colors, fonts, animations) is crucial. Ensure that the UI/UX is consistent across various components and screen sizes, and factor in additional testing for hover and click states.
