# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user opens Maestro, the application launches with a splash screen that reflects the brand’s modern and professional look. The launch process immediately checks for network connectivity and displays a clear message if the device is offline, while still allowing users to view previously saved conversations and settings. Since Maestro is designed for single-user use without formal account creation, users are not prompted to sign in or create an account. Instead, the onboarding process focuses on introducing users to the interface with a brief welcome screen that outlines the key functionalities and layout. There is no need for a password recovery process because no user credentials are required. All setup involves automatically loading the locally stored chat history and user preferences so that users can begin interacting with the app right away.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once the application has launched and any connectivity issues have been addressed, the main dashboard or home page is presented in a clean three-panel layout. The left sidebar displays conversation history and model selection options, allowing users to quickly browse previous chats or switch between different AI models like OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, Ollama, and OpenRouter. The central area is dedicated to active conversations where messages are exchanged with real-time responses, and the right sidebar is reserved for artifacts that capture key dialogue excerpts and important data points. The top header may include simple navigation controls such as settings or information about connectivity status, and the entire interface is styled with a bright blue theme, complemented by a minimalist design that uses modern typography according to the brand’s guidelines. This dashboard provides a seamless transition point to any other function within the app simply by clicking on the desired area in the navigation menus or the sidebar elements.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user starts a new conversation, they simply click on a clear “New Chat” option located near the conversation list in the left sidebar. This action brings them directly into a clean conversational window in the central section of the app. The design ensures that users can easily differentiate between initiating a new chat and revisiting previous discussions. As messages are entered into the chat window, they are sent to the various integrated AI models via a unified API interface, enabling text-based conversations, code generation with syntax highlighting, and streaming responses. Users can adjust conversation parameters such as temperature and context within an advanced settings panel accessible from the top area of the chat window. When results are generated and significant dialogue moments occur, these can be captured automatically as artifacts. These artifacts appear in the right sidebar and can be further interacted with, annotated, or exported. The flow between these pages is smooth, with natural transitions managed by subtle animations that help users understand that they are moving from one section to another without interruption. The interface also allows users to switch focus between the conversation window, the sidebar for browsing past chats, and the artifacts display, ensuring that the entire workflow is connected and intuitive.

## Settings and Account Management

Although Maestro does not require traditional user accounts, there is a settings page that allows users to manage their preferences conveniently. This settings page can be accessed from the navigation header and includes options to adjust appearance settings, such as switching between light and dark modes and tweaking the color emphasis based on the guaranteed brand color of bright blue. Users can also manage local storage settings for their chat history, configure notifications, and adjust parameters for the integrated AI models directly from this view. Any changes made in the settings are saved locally immediately and the user is smoothly redirected back to the main dashboard with those updates in effect. This flow ensures that users are always aware of how to change their experience without disrupting the continuous workflow of the application.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If users encounter issues such as incorrect input or connectivity problems, Maestro provides clear and friendly error messages. In the event that the network is lost, the app immediately notifies the user with a non-intrusive banner that indicates new conversations cannot be started until connectivity is restored. Additionally, if there is an issue with the AI models responding (for example, due to API errors or rate limitations), a clear, simple message appears within the conversation window, and users may be offered guidance on possible steps to retry their request. Since all chat histories and settings are stored locally, even if errors occur during active sessions, users can always access their past data. These error messages and alternate flows allow the user to easily understand how to recover from any interruption and maintain continuous engagement with the app.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

In summary, Maestro provides a smooth journey from the moment the application is launched to the point where users engage in dynamic, multi-model conversations. The experience begins with a welcoming splash and immediate local initialization that informs users of network status and available chat histories. The main dashboard introduces users to a clear three-panel layout complete with conversation history, active communication area, and artifact display. Users can start new chats, revisit old conversations, and interact with advanced features such as parameter adjustments and MCP server integrations—all managed through an intuitive and visually appealing interface. Even when connectivity issues arise, Maestro gracefully transitions into an offline mode, ensuring that previously saved data remains available and the overall experience is never disrupted. This end-to-end journey ensures that every step is interconnected, leaving no ambiguity about how to move within and across the various functionalities of the application.
