# Maestro AI Chat Assistant - Backend Structure Document

This document explains the backend architecture and infrastructure for Maestro in everyday language. Maestro is designed to offer a seamless, reliable experience when communicating with multiple AI models. Below is an overview of the design, components, and strategies used to support scalability, security, and performance.

## Backend Architecture

Maestro's backend is built on a modular and scalable design leveraging modern frameworks and design patterns. Here's an overview:

- The desktop application is built using **Tauri 2.0** and **Rust**, which provides a lightweight yet powerful native layer to run the backend logic on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- The backend uses a modular approach where each component—such as API integration with various AI services, chat history management, and MCP server integration—is separated into distinct modules. This ensures that updates to one module don't disrupt others.
- For cloud-based storage and synchronization, Maestro leverages **Supabase**. Supabase acts as a centralized service that stores chat histories, settings, and artifacts while ensuring data integrity and quick access.
- Design patterns such as separation of concerns and modular design make the code easy to maintain and scale as user demand grows. This makes the system robust enough to handle increasing traffic and seamless enhancement over time.
- Communication between the frontend and backend is structured, straightforward, and follows RESTful conventions.

## Database Management

Maestro uses Supabase as its cloud storage solution, which provides a PostgreSQL-based SQL database. Key points include:

- **Database Technology:** SQL (PostgreSQL provided by Supabase)
- **Data Storage:** Chat history, user settings, MCP server details, and artifacts are stored in structured tables.
- **Data Access:** Information is accessed through secure API calls. The design ensures data is efficiently indexed and can be retrieved quickly for a smooth user experience.
- **Data Management Practices:** Regular backups, indexing, and monitoring ensure data integrity and availability. Supabase's automated maintenance also keeps the database optimized as the application scales.

## Database Schema

Below is a human-readable format of the database schema used by Maestro. The schema is designed for a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.

- **Users Table**
  - Contains data about the users with authentication-related information.
  - Key Columns: UserID (unique identifier), email, display name, password hash, and creation timestamp.

- **ChatHistory Table**
  - Stores conversation histories for each user.
  - Key Columns: ChatID (unique identifier), UserID (links to Users table), conversation data (text and metadata), and timestamp.

- **Artifacts Table**
  - Records key moments in dialogue (artifacts) as inspired by Claude.
  - Key Columns: ArtifactID (unique identifier), ChatID (links to ChatHistory), artifact content, and timestamp.

- **Settings Table**
  - Holds user-specific configuration settings.
  - Key Columns: SettingsID (unique identifier), UserID, preferences (theme, language, etc.), and last updated timestamp.

- **MCP_Servers Table**
  - Stores information about user-added MCP servers which support custom tool extensions and function calls.
  - Key Columns: ServerID (unique identifier), UserID, server configuration details (address, port, authentication tokens), and timestamp.

*(For a more technical view, a SQL version of this schema can be generated that creates tables with the above columns and relationships.)*

## API Design and Endpoints

Maestro's APIs are designed based on RESTful principles to ensure simplicity and clarity for communication between the frontend and backend:

- **General Approach:**
  - Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.
  - Follows conventional routing so that each endpoint has a clear responsibility.

- **Key API Endpoints:**
  - **Authentication Endpoints:** 
    - POST /auth/register: Registers a new user
    - POST /auth/login: Authenticates a user and returns session information
    - POST /auth/logout: Invalidates user session
  - **Chat API Endpoints:**
    - GET /chat-history: Retrieves the conversation history for a user.
    - POST /chat: Sends a new message to the backend, which then routes it to the appropriate AI service.
  - **Artifacts Endpoints:**
    - GET /artifacts: Fetches saved artifacts for a user.
    - POST /artifacts: Saves a new artifact extracted from a chat.
  - **MCP Server Endpoints:**
    - GET /mcp-servers: Lists user-configured MCP servers.
    - POST /mcp-servers: Allows adding a new MCP server configuration.
    - DELETE /mcp-servers: Removes an existing MCP server configuration.
  - **Settings Endpoints:**
    - GET /settings: Retrieves user preferences and configuration settings.
    - PUT /settings: Updates user settings, such as theme or language preferences.

## Hosting Solutions

The hosting for Maestro's backend is designed for stability and ease of scaling:

- **Cloud Provider:** Maestro leverages **Supabase** for cloud-based data storage and syncing. Supabase is a cost-effective, highly scalable solution that comes with its own set of maintenance and backup utilities.
- **Desktop Application:** The core application is a cross-platform desktop app that runs locally on the user's machine (using Tauri 2.0), while always connecting to cloud-hosted services for data sync.
- **Authentication System:** The app uses a **custom authentication system** built on React Context API, localStorage, and cookie-based session management for a streamlined user experience that integrates directly with the application frontend.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Reliability:** Cloud services like Supabase offer high uptime and built-in fault tolerance.
  - **Scalability:** The cloud infrastructure can handle increased loads as user numbers grow.
  - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Using managed hosting services minimizes operational overhead and reduces costs.
  - **Simplicity:** The custom authentication system eliminates the need for external authentication providers while maintaining security.

## Infrastructure Components

To drive performance and ensure smooth user experiences, Maestro utilizes several key infrastructure components:

- **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming requests to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. This is particularly important during peak usage, ensuring quick responses.
- **Caching Mechanisms:** While explicit caching solutions like Redis aren't detailed, Supabase's inbuilt caching and the natural efficiencies of PostgreSQL help reduce data access times.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Although the primary focus is on desktop application functionality, static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript may be served via a CDN, enhancing load times globally.
- **Security Middleware:** The application implements middleware for route protection, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.

## Security Measures

Security is a critical component in Maestro's backend. Here's how it is addressed:

- **User Authentication:** The custom authentication system handles user registration, login, and session management through a secure implementation using React Context API and Web Storage mechanisms.
- **Dual Authentication Verification:** Uses both localStorage for client-side state management and HTTP-only cookies for server-side session verification.
- **Data Encryption:** Data transmitted between the client and the backend is safeguarded using TLS encryption.
- **API Key Management:** Users manage their own API keys for each integrated AI service, reducing security risks associated with centralized key storage.
- **Access Controls:** Every endpoint includes checks to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify data.
- **Compliance:** Regular security reviews and updates ensure that Maestro adheres to best practices and relevant data protection standards.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Ongoing monitoring and proactive maintenance are essential to keep the backend healthy:

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Use built-in Supabase monitoring features to track database performance, uptime, and potential issues.
  - Application logs generated by Tauri and Rust are reviewed to spot any anomalies.
- **Maintenance Strategies:**
  - Regular updates to the backend code ensure compatibility and performance improvements.
  - Automated backups via Supabase help prevent data loss and support quick restoration if needed.
  - Error tracking systems alert the team to issues so they can be resolved swiftly, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary
