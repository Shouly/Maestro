# Maestro AI App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user launches Maestro, they are first greeted by an elegant landing page that introduces the application’s purpose and key features. The user is presented with a clean and modern authentication screen powered by Clerk Auth. Here, new users can either create an account or sign in using their preferred method. Signing up involves entering a valid email address and password, or using available social login options if provided. Once the user submits their sign-up details, a confirmation process (which may include email verification) is initiated to secure their account. For returning users, the sign-in page offers a straightforward form to log in with their existing credentials. In the event of a forgotten password, users can access a “Forgot Password” feature where they enter their registered email to receive recovery instructions. Although the application supports multiple sign-in methods, the process remains intuitive and direct, ensuring that every user is onboarded with clarity and efficiency.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successful authentication, the user lands on the main dashboard, which serves as the central hub of Maestro. The dashboard is organized into a distinct three-panel layout, promoting a clear separation of conversation history, active chats, and the work artifacts area. The left panel displays the user’s chat history, giving them easy access to past interactions. The center area hosts the ongoing chat interface where users engage with various AI models, and the right panel is dedicated to capturing important moments and work artifacts inspired by Claude’s functionality. Navigation elements such as headers and a sidebar allow users to smoothly access other parts of the application, including settings or subscription management, while brief animations and a minimalist design create a clean, distraction-free environment for the user.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

As users dive deeper into Maestro, they will first be prompted to set up integrations with multiple AI models such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, Ollama, and OpenRouter. At this stage, the application asks users to supply their own API keys to independently connect to each service. Once the API keys are entered and verified, the active chat area becomes fully functional. Users can initiate text-based conversations, receive streaming AI responses, and view generated code with syntax highlighting. The interaction between the user and the AI models is fluid and is enhanced by subtle animations that give feedback in real time. If a user is interested in additional functionality, they can navigate to a dedicated configuration page for MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration. In this section, users can add and manage their MCP servers, enabling custom tool extensions such as file access and data analysis. The workflow is designed to ensure that transitions between chat sessions, MCP configuration, and other functionalities are seamless, creating an interconnected experience where each page naturally leads to the next.

## Settings and Account Management

Within Maestro, users have full control over their personal information, preferences, and service integrations. A dedicated settings page is easily accessible from the main dashboard through the navigation menus. Here, users can update account details, manage notifications, and adjust layout preferences like switching between light and dark themes. In addition to personal settings, there is an area for subscription management that clearly differentiates the free and premium versions of Maestro, enabling users to upgrade their account and activate additional features if desired. The settings interface also includes a section for entering and updating API keys and managing MCP server settings, ensuring that all integrations remain current. After making any adjustments in the account management area, users can easily return to the main dashboard where their changes are immediately reflected in their ongoing experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

While using Maestro, users may occasionally encounter errors or invalid inputs. If a user tries to log in with an incorrect password or submits incomplete sign-up details, the system will immediately display clear and concise error messages directing them to correct these issues. In the chat interface, if a user provides an invalid API key, the system will notify them with a prompt to re-enter the credentials and offer guidance on where to find valid keys. In cases of network connectivity problems, the app halts operations and displays a fallback screen indicating that a network connection is required, as offline usage is not supported. Additionally, if the MCP server configuration fails due to incorrect input or server unavailability, a detailed error explanation is provided along with suggested corrective actions. This defensive design ensures that users are never left in a confusing state, and each error message is a clear guide back into the normal workflow of the application.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

Maestro provides a seamless user journey that begins with a clean and straightforward onboarding experience. A new user is welcomed by an elegant authentication screen, guided through simple and secure account creation, and immediately immersed in a highly functional three-panel dashboard. From entering and managing API keys for multiple AI models to engaging in live chats and utilizing custom tool integrations through MCP server settings, every action in Maestro is designed to be intuitive and interconnected. Users can manage their personal settings and subscriptions with ease, ensuring that their workflow remains consistent and personalized across devices. Despite potential interruptions due to error states, the application provides helpful feedback and clear paths to resolution, guaranteeing that all users—from AI enthusiasts to professional researchers—can enjoy a reliable and visually appealing platform for their daily AI interactions.
